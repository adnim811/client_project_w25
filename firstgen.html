            <h2>Who is a First-Generation Student?</h2>
            <p>At the University of Michigan, undergraduates and graduate students are considered first-generation college students if neither parent or guardian has completed a four-year college or university degree. This definition includes students with other family members (siblings, cousins, grandparents, etc.) who have completed a four-year degree.</p>
